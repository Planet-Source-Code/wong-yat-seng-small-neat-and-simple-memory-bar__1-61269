### Description

This a simple memory monitor that tracks your physical memory, page file memory, and virtual memory. Sure, there are many similar submissions that does a lot more tasks like a task manager, but mine is small but yet informative, without taking up much of desktop space.

*New version released: Please refer to submission on Memory Bar 1.3 at
